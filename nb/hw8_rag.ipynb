      "THE RISE and rise of the Australian strawberry, raspberry and blackberry industries has seen the sectors redouble their international trade focus, with the release of a dedicated export plan to grow their global presence over the next 10 years.\n",
      "Driven by significant grower input, the Berry Export Summary 2028 maps the sectors’ current position, where they want to be, high-opportunity markets and next steps.\n",
      "Hort Innovation trade manager Jenny Van de Meeberg said the value and volume of raspberry and blackberry exports rose by 100 per cent between 2016 and 2017. She said the Australian strawberry industry experienced similar success with an almost 30 per cent rise in export volume and a 26 per cent rise in value to $32.6M over the same period.\n",
      "“Australian berry sectors are in a firm position at the moment,” she said. “Production, adoption of protected substrate cropping, improved genetics and an expanding geographic footprint have all helped put Aussie berries on a positive trajectory.\n",
      "“We are seeing a real transition point. Broad industry interest and a strong commercial appetite for export market development combined with the potential to capitalise on existing trade agreements and build new trade partnerships has created this perfect environment for growth.”\n",
      "High-income countries across Europe, North America and Northern Asia have been identified as having a palate for Australian grown berries with more than 4244 tonnes of fresh berries exported in the last financial year alone.\n",
      "The strategy identified the best short-term prospect markets for the Australian blackberry and raspberry industry as Hong Kong, Singapore, The United Arab Emirates and Canada. The strongest short-term trade options identified for the strawberry sector were Thailand, Malaysia, New Zealand and Macau.\n",
      "The strategy focuses heavily on growing the existing strawberry export market from 4 per cent to at least 8 per cent of national production by volume, in markets with a capacity and willingness to pay a premium for quality fruit. For raspberries and blackberries, the sectors aim to achieve a 5 per cent boost in exports assessed by volume across identified markets by 2021.\n",
      "Tasmanian raspberry exporter Nic Hansen said Australia offers some of the sweetest and most attractive berries in the world, and this combined with our stringent food safety standards across all stages of the supply chain puts growers in a solid position.\n",
      "“We have a great product, we are hungry to expand trade and now with this new plan in place, we have a clear roadmap towards driving growth,” Mr Hansen said.\n",
      "He said it is exciting to see new export market prospects for raspberries: “The more options we have for export the better. Now we just have to get on with the job of ensuring industry has all the tools it needs, such as supporting data and relationship building opportunities, to thrive in new markets.”\n",
      "This project was commissioned by Hort Innovation, and developed by market analysts and research consultants Auspex Strategic Advisory and AgInfinity. Hort Innovation will work now with berry sectors to determine levy-funded activities to support trade.\n",
      "See a summary of the strategy on the Hort Innovation website.\n",
      "For more information on the berry industries, refer to the Horticulture Statistics Handbook and the Strategic Investment Plans for strawberries, raspberries and blackberries. Growers seeking more information should email trade@horticulture.com.au \n",

Recently, astronomers even voiced concerns over a plan to design robotic lawn mowers that would run on radio waves. The perytons in particular interfered with this team’s main mission: to understand the source of fast radio bursts, brief but brilliant signals with potential extragalactic origins. Both perytons and fast radio bursts have a distinct look to them, in that their lower frequencies arrive noticeably later than their higher ones.

Lower frequencies (longer wavelengths) of radio emission interact more with the electrons than higher frequencies do, and so the lower frequencies end up delayed, like an extrovert trying to leave a party. The higher the time delay, the further the signal has traveled. Most astronomers think fast radio bursts originate as far as 10 billion light-years away.

While focussing on the literary issues the book also gives an account of the development of public-sector decision-making – albeit in one tiny part of the system. One of my grumbles about our teaching of public policy is that insufficient attention is given to how it actually happens. There are few careful studies; the book adds to them. Because it is over a five-decade period, the story shows an evolving public policy process.

Post new comment\", 'BRitual citizens trapped in Kabul have described feeling abandoned by UK officials when it became clear that promised help with the evacuation seemed increasingly unlikely after news that repatriation flights would soon be suspended. Nine British nationals waiting to be evacuated this week said they had not heard from British officials since Thursday night and were feeling increasingly desperate for the possibility of returning to their UK homes.

All said they were increasingly concerned for their safety. They expressed frustration that it had become impossible to contact the Foreign Ministry’s Afghanistan helpline and said that emails sent to the dedicated Afghan assistance account were not being answered. It is unclear how many British passport holders remain stranded in Afghanistan or how many eligible people are still awaiting evacuation. Ministers said there were only 1,100 people left to rescue, but it seems likely that this figure significantly underestimates the total number of people who have been promised emergency visas.

The guards who provided security for the British embassy in Kabul were also pessimistic about their chances of fleeing Afghanistan on Friday, following a failed attempt by international security firm GardaWorld to evacuate them. “We successfully rounded up 185 families of British embassy workers, about 1,000 people in total, and took them to the airport, but they wouldn’t let us in,” said the guard supervisor. “Right now there is', 'families of British embassy workers, about 1,000 people in total, and took them to the airport, but they wouldn’t let us in,” said the guard supervisor. “Right now there is no hope for us.” Oliver Westmacott, GardaWorld president for the Middle East and Africa, said attempts to remove the guards would continue either by land or on commercial flights “once things settle down in the next few months.” A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “More than 13,700 people, including British citizens, our Afghan staff and others at risk, have been evacuated from Afghanistan by the UK since Saturday 14 August in', 'Office spokesperson said: “More than 13,700 people, including British citizens, our Afghan staff and others at risk, have been evacuated from Afghanistan by the UK since Saturday 14 August in one of the largest operations of this type in history. “We will continue to do everything we can to fulfill our obligation to remove eligible British and Afghan citizens from the country for as long as the security situation allows.” George is Digismak’s reported cum editor with 13 years of experience in Journalism', 'George is Digismak’s reported cum editor with 13 years of experience in Journalism', 'It’s no secret that the modern day education system, particularly in North America, desperately needs to be reformed. Children graduate from high school not understanding how to produce their own food, pay their taxes, or accomplish many everyday, “real world” activities. The education system’s sole purpose should be to educate us in order to better ourselves and society, but instead it just tells us what to think (rather than how to think), so we learn only how to assimilate and blend into society. Many children graduate not even realizing that the system is broken because they’re so engrained within it.', 'to think), so we learn only how to assimilate and blend into society. Many children graduate not even realizing that the system is broken because they’re so engrained within it. In some cases, they’re even fed propaganda and misinformation. Just take a look in any history textbook: You’d likely see that the Europeans founded North America, completely omitting the mass genocide that took place against Native Americans. Alternatively, if you look into milk education or the Food Guide Pyramid that’s taught to children at a young age in schools, you’d learn that it does not reflect what’s healthy, but rather', 'look into milk education or the Food Guide Pyramid that’s taught to children at a young age in schools, you’d learn that it does not reflect what’s healthy, but rather what’s profitable. The good news is that this isn’t the case in every country, and some countries are even trying to shift the way we approach education. Finland, a longstanding leader in education, is in the process of completely reforming its education system.

Finland will be adopting a “phenomenon-based learning” system, allowing students to drop the standard subjects and experience more holistic, interdisciplinary learning. What Is Phenomenon-Based Learning? Phenomenon-based learning takes a very different approach to education, dropping the classic divide amongst subjects like math and science. Instead, students take one particular phenomenon or concept and look at it through multiple lenses, applying it to whatever subjects pertain to it such as geography, history, or economics. As Phenomenal Education explains on its website:. So, students would no longer study just one subject like physics, but a whole range of subjects', 'such as geography, history, or economics. As Phenomenal Education explains on its website:. So, students would no longer study just one subject like physics, but a whole range of subjects that relate to one topic, taking a more interdisciplinary approach. For example, students could look at the European Union, which could then incorporate languages, economics, history, and geography, and then they could look at climate change the following week, which might involve science, environmental studies, economics, and policy. The teacher-student relationship will also change fairly dramatically, as students will take a combination of online and in-class courses. The dialogue between', 'might involve science, environmental studies, economics, and policy. The teacher-student relationship will also change fairly dramatically, as students will take a combination of online and in-class courses. The dialogue between students, peers, and teachers will also shift, as students will be encouraged to speak more openly and share information. The structure will be less hierarchical and more of a team-based setting, greatly differing from the classic “teacher instructs student” mentality.

This is great news, as it will hopefully engage students more and shift testing away from focusing only on traditional written exams. How Finland Will Be Implementing This New Approach Finland is well-known for being one of the leading countries in education, with incredibly high literacy and numeracy rates.

In fact, one of the world’s leading experts on school reform and education, Harvard professor Pasi Sahlberg, has written numerous articles on Finland’s education system. Sahlberg has worked hard to share Finland’s experiences with education reform with the rest of the world, and for good reason. Finland didn’t always have incredible education statistics, but the country holds a strong appreciation for teaching and learning and has undergone significant educational change.

Finland doesn’t use these scores to assess its education system; instead, educators focus on what students need to learn in their lives, not what the exams or rankings say. The Finnish education system is also decentralized, allowing teachers to alter their lesson plans and arrange schooling according to their local needs and preferences. This greatly differs from the more centralized approach taken in the public education systems in North America. The Finnish approach to education is already quite innovative, so perhaps that’s why so many teachers are on board with', 'approach taken in the public education systems in North America. The Finnish approach to education is already quite innovative, so perhaps that’s why so many teachers are on board with this shift in teaching. In fact, 70% of the teachers in Helsinki are in some way involved in shifting the education system towards phenomenon-based learning. Some teachers had already started implementing phenomenon-based learning in their classrooms. This isn’t really surprising, as it seems like it would be more rewarding for teachers to be able to connect with students more and teach them what they’d actually like to learn. Finland plans', 'as it seems like it would be more rewarding for teachers to be able to connect with students more and teach them what they’d actually like to learn. Finland plans to gradually change the system, so schools won’t be fully phenomenon-based learning until 2020. The first big change occurred in August 2016 under Finland’s National Curriculum Framework (NCF). The NCF is a binding document that highlights the overall goals of the education system including teaching techniques, learning styles, guidelines, assessments, support services, and more. The NCF now incorporates phenomenal-based learning and encourages an interdisciplinary approach to teaching. However, this style', 'the education system including teaching techniques, learning styles, guidelines, assessments, support services, and more. The NCF now incorporates phenomenal-based learning and encourages an interdisciplinary approach to teaching. However, this style wasn’t necessarily new to the Finnish, as some teachers have used a more holistic teaching method for quite some time. As of August, public schools with students aged 7-16 years old need to have one extended period using phenomenon-based learning, the length of which can be determined by the school. Many schools just have two or more periods, each lasting a few weeks, that take this approach. Why Is This', 'the length of which can be determined by the school. Many schools just have two or more periods, each lasting a few weeks, that take this approach. Why Is This Important? Many children don’t have a perfect “family life,” so they learn through their experiences outside the home or by themselves. This is why the argument that “children don’t need to be taught practical subjects in school” is so flawed. The education system is supposed to represent the entirety of what we want children — who represent our future — to learn. So why would we be feeding them propaganda', 'The education system is supposed to represent the entirety of what we want children — who represent our future — to learn. So why would we be feeding them propaganda and teaching them that there’s only one way to think, one way to feel, and one way to determine intelligence?

The plan lays out four broad goals to provide a strategic vision for safety across the Army, said Tad Davis, deputy assistant secretary of the Army for Environment, Safety and Occupational Health. First among those broad goals is the incorporation of safety and occupational health into Army culture. \"We want to reduce complacency -- for folks to take the same careful attention they do every time they get in the car, the vehicle, the helicopter or every time', '\"We want to reduce complacency -- for folks to take the same careful attention they do every time they get in the car, the vehicle, the helicopter or every time they make a parachute jump,\" Davis said. \"What we want them to do is assess the risks associated with the action they are going to take and take the proactive measures.\" Ensuring proactive and systematic management of risk is also important.

Davis said that means leadership makes it part of their organizational routine to continually look at and identify ahead of time the risks of the workplace. That includes off-duty time, and combat or contingency operations. They can then use what they have identified to find ways to minimize that risk. The Army has a cadre of safety professionals, Davis said, who must manage the Army safety and occupational health program efficiently and effectively. That too is a goal outlined in the plan. \"Our safety professionals in particular are providing tremendous dividends for our Soldiers both at home when they', 'program efficiently and effectively. That too is a goal outlined in the plan. \"Our safety professionals in particular are providing tremendous dividends for our Soldiers both at home when they are in garrison doing training and preparatory activity, and when they forward deploy on contingency operations,\" Davis said. Ensuring career paths, career planning and training for those professionals is important, Davis said. Also important to safety program management is the process of fielding a single reporting system to the entire Army that will assist leaders and supervisors at every level in doing a better job of reporting accidents when they', 'process of fielding a single reporting system to the entire Army that will assist leaders and supervisors at every level in doing a better job of reporting accidents when they occur. Until now, the Army\\'s had as many as eight systems for accident reporting, Davis said. Finally, the reduction of the accident and illness rates in the Army is a very broad goal included in the plan. That goal is accomplished through programs at every installation and organization within the Army, Davis said. \"The Safety Center down at Fort Rucker has developed a host of leading edge initiatives in the', 'accomplished through programs at every installation and organization within the Army, Davis said. \"The Safety Center down at Fort Rucker has developed a host of leading edge initiatives in the areas of privately owned vehicles and driving safety to motorcycle safety in particular\" to further the Army\\'s accident reduction goals, Davis said, adding that there\\'s good feedback coming from those programs. There were 299 accidental fatalities among Soldiers in fiscal year 2005; that number dropped to 240 in 2006, rose slightly to 250 in 2007, dropped again to 210 in 2008, and then dropped again to 173 in 2009.

So far this year, there are 99 accidental fatalities in the Army -- less than the number of deaths at the same time each year since 2005. \"We\\'re doing better now than we did last year, not by much, but I think that we\\'ll continue to show progress,\" Davis said.

Of the 99 accidental deaths so far in fiscal year 2010, 27 have been on-duty deaths and 72 were off-duty. Davis said that the number of on-duty accidental deaths is stabilizing and that the number of off-duty accidental deaths in the Army is decreasing. The largest number of those off-duty deaths this year are from accidents in privately owned vehicles -- and those numbers are broken down by vehicle type: 28 from sedans, 16 from motorcycles, and 11 from other vehicles such as vans, SUVs, mopeds or all-terrain vehicles. \"The motorcycle', 'and those numbers are broken down by vehicle type: 28 from sedans, 16 from motorcycles, and 11 from other vehicles such as vans, SUVs, mopeds or all-terrain vehicles. \"The motorcycle area is one where we spend a lot of time and effort,\" Davis said. \"We have seen a big push at every level within every organization that really focuses on motorcycle safety.

To ride a motorcycle on an Army installation, for instance, a Soldier must have first taken a motorcycle safety course. The Army also has programs to pair new riders with more experienced ones. \"A lot of time when you\\'re dealing with motorcycles, one of the key factors there with fatalities is experience,\" Davis said. Other large risk factors involve non-motorcycle POVs. \"There\\'s two things: speed and seatbelts,\" Davis said. \"As we look at the accident reports that come in, it just', 'experience,\" Davis said. Other large risk factors involve non-motorcycle POVs. \"There\\'s two things: speed and seatbelts,\" Davis said. \"As we look at the accident reports that come in, it just shocks you that probably in the range of 25 to 35 percent of those fatalities involve Soldiers that weren\\'t wearing their seat belts.\" For on-the-job safety, the Army is also making efforts, including aviation safety and ground safety. On-duty safety can be improved with training, Davis said. One such example is with the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle program. The Army is working to designate more MRAPs for training purposes', 'can be improved with training, Davis said. One such example is with the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle program.

The same efforts were made for the up-armored Humvee, three to four years ago, Davis said.

Crew coordination continues to be an essential element of aviation activities, Davis said. And the Army has also increased training for high altitude operations, in light of the high altitude conditions Army aviators operate under in Afghanistan. Another big factor in safety, Davis said, is leadership and peer-to-peer engagement. \"Soldiers themselves can really help one another, whether it\\'s preparing a mortar round to be fired or setting head space and timing on a .50-cal machine gun -- everybody is watching one', 'can really help one another, whether it\\'s preparing a mortar round to be fired or setting head space and timing on a .50-cal machine gun -- everybody is watching one another,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, if the headspace and timing is not set properly, it could injure not only the person firing but other people.\" Soldiers can also ask themselves over the summer if drinking a six-pack of beer is a good idea before boating or getting on a jet ski.

Here she shares four helpful steps to achieving successful works of art. by Colleen Howe, as told to Collin Fry Growing up on a ranch in the Big Hole Valley of Southwestern Montana, I developed an early appreciation for nature and a love of painting the great outdoors.

Each one of these steps builds on the previous one, resulting in a system that virtually guarantees satisfactory results. With this approach, one establishes a solid foundation and mistakes are dealt with early, leaving one free to move into the final painting stages without later disappointment and frustration. Step 1: Establish the ConceptStarting with a strong concept is essential to a painting’s success. The picture’s concept can be a scene, an object, or a person, or it can be a color scheme', 'ConceptStarting with a strong concept is essential to a painting’s success. The picture’s concept can be a scene, an object, or a person, or it can be a color scheme or composition. For example, I love painting the West. The light and landscape are wonderful, and there is a wide variety of subjects from which to choose. In both my studio painting and my plein air work, I like to create a sense of place or a moment in time, perhaps capturing something spiritual or poetic about a location. For my painting concept I look for unique light, shadow shapes,', 'create a sense of place or a moment in time, perhaps capturing something spiritual or poetic about a location. For my painting concept I look for unique light, shadow shapes, or moods at different times of day or during various weather conditions. My goal in painting is to make the landscape breathe by depicting the atmosphere and energy of plant life and terrain. Step 2: Experiment With Small SketchesAfter my picture concept has been decided, I create several small sketches, working out my ideas, composition, values, and color plan for the painting. Experience has taught me that I can confidently', 'picture concept has been decided, I create several small sketches, working out my ideas, composition, values, and color plan for the painting. Experience has taught me that I can confidently move into a finished painting if I have first worked out an interesting composition and pattern of values and color with small studies. I also find that ideas come more quickly and creatively when doing quick, intuitive sketching. Issues of design, structure, and color harmony are much more easily dealt with when painting in a small format (usually 9\" x 12\" or smaller). It may seem time-consuming or laborious to', 'design, structure, and color harmony are much more easily dealt with when painting in a small format (usually 9\" x 12\" or smaller). It may seem time-consuming or laborious to include this step at first, but with practice one learns to quickly put down the important information from a scene that will be needed. Improvement in one’s work can be dramatic, with unforeseen breakthroughs happening through the sketching process. Any artist, no matter how experienced, will benefit from taking this vital step. Step 3: Develop the Sketches Into Value and Color StudiesI continue thinking about composition in this stage as', 'artist, no matter how experienced, will benefit from taking this vital step. Step 3: Develop the Sketches Into Value and Color StudiesI continue thinking about composition in this stage as I explore value and color possibilities and try different approaches. To complete the preliminary stage, the flat value shapes are indicated, without trying to depict specific objects or things. Next, these various shapes are connected into a simple pattern of light and dark values. After this is finished, I work from the value study to make a color study of the same size, translating the values into color. When these', 'light and dark values. After this is finished, I work from the value study to make a color study of the same size, translating the values into color. When these studies are complete, I have a plan and am ready to start a finished painting. I’ve noticed in my workshops that many students want to skip over these preparatory steps and don’t give enough thought to the basic issues of composition, value, and color. With patient effort and repeated demonstrations, I win them over to my practice of preliminary planning and sketching, which I’ve come to rely on after years', 'composition, value, and color. With patient effort and repeated demonstrations, I win them over to my practice of preliminary planning and sketching, which I’ve come to rely on after years of painting and trial and error. It’s wise to invest in planning at the beginning because it will pay back handsomely later, saving considerable time and allowing for much more freedom when creating the final painting. Step 4: Paint Confidently, Using the Value and Color Studies as a GuideI keep my studies close for reference and use them as a road map as I move into the final painting. Sometimes', 'Using the Value and Color Studies as a GuideI keep my studies close for reference and use them as a road map as I move into the final painting. Sometimes dramatically increasing the scale from the preliminary sketch can prove difficult, and it can be hard to maintain the freshness achieved in the original. For this reason, care must be taken to avoid a labored or overworked look when translating the subject to a bigger surface. Strokes should be spontaneous and shapes kept simple while constantly referring to the preliminary studies. For my own paintings, I work in both pastel', 'the subject to a bigger surface. Strokes should be spontaneous and shapes kept simple while constantly referring to the preliminary studies. For my own paintings, I work in both pastel and oil and find both media to be wonderful for building rich hues, beautiful light grays, and subtly colored whites.

The US is already home to some of the best wireless networks in the world. These have driven untold innovations in devices and applications, which have improved our lives and added billions to our GDP. Experts, however, agree: our networks will not be able to meet requirements for new applications and devices coming up in the next few years. The future of our wireless networks depends on the future of our wireline networks. Specifically,', 'to meet requirements for new applications and devices coming up in the next few years. The future of our wireless networks depends on the future of our wireline networks. Specifically, the projected performance and readiness of 5G wireless depends on the availability of fiber. Fiber has not traditionally been the first thing to come to mind when people think about wireless, but it should be. Meeting performance goals touted for 5G networks — high capacity, low latency, and extreme reliability — depends on having lots of fiber in lots of places. Driving 5G With the Internet of Things Until recently,', '5G networks — high capacity, low latency, and extreme reliability — depends on having lots of fiber in lots of places. Driving 5G With the Internet of Things Until recently, people used the Internet to connect with each other, conduct brief transactions, and get information. Now, we connect physical objects to the Internet and to each other through small, embedded sensors. The ecosystem this creates, the Internet of Things (IoT), is one of ubiquitous, distributed computing, where “smart” devices securely collect and transmit data to other devices automatically and in real time. The Internet of Things, which has industrial, consumer', 'is one of ubiquitous, distributed computing, where “smart” devices securely collect and transmit data to other devices automatically and in real time. The Internet of Things, which has industrial, consumer and civic uses, will drive economic growth and further change the way we live, work, and run our cities. These technologies will be critical for our economy: Consumer Technology Association projections show that in 2016 alone, IoT applications will help drive 30% of the consumer technology industry’s overall $287 billion in retail revenues.

This does not include industrial, commercial, and city-level applications. The IoT needs a better network: one that is unified rather than disconnected, capable of delivering high data rates and providing low latency, and covering broader areas. That’s the promise of 5G networks: • Up to 1,000 times increase in bandwidth over 4G networks. • Up to 100 times more connected devices. • Up to 10 Gbps connection rates to mobile devices in the field. • No greater than 1 millisecond of latency, something nearly indistinguishable to the', 'times more connected devices. • Up to 10 Gbps connection rates to mobile devices in the field. • No greater than 1 millisecond of latency, something nearly indistinguishable to the human video watcher. The promise of 5G is great — and indeed essential to the widespread adoption of IoT technologies — but so are the challenges to network deployment. 2G and 3G wireless networks often used copper-based backhaul to connect cell sites. While these networks have served consumers well, carriers and network operators all over the country are converting these legacy systems over to fiber. Why? Because fiber is a', 'cell sites. While these networks have served consumers well, carriers and network operators all over the country are converting these legacy systems over to fiber. Why? Because fiber is a future-proof technology, capable of supporting higher capacities and the low latencies that our 5G networks will need. Areas targeted for 5G coverage require lots of fiber to be successful, not just for capacity reasons, but also to meet the other performance goals related to network diversity, availability, and coverage, since all 3 of these goals are achieved through a greater number of interconnected paths of fiber. As wireless networks grow,', 'performance goals related to network diversity, availability, and coverage, since all 3 of these goals are achieved through a greater number of interconnected paths of fiber. As wireless networks grow, through small cells and macro cells, fiber will continue to be the first-choice technology as the building blocks. Seeing It in the Market You don’t have to take my word for it — you can see this in some of the movement, mergers, and acquisitions in the industry.

Windstream recently finalized its purchase of EarthLink, gaining 29,000 route miles of fiber. Analysts believe that 5G and network densification are at the heart of moves like this. In their evaluation of CenturyLink’s recent purchase of Level 3, Barclays analysts noted that .” This transaction gives CenturyLink an additional 200,000 route miles of fiber. The list of fiber acquisitions continues to grow. Crown Castle announced a potential purchase of FPL FiberNet, and Verizon is in the process of acquiring XO Communications. How to Help 5G — and Fiber? Unlike the current 4G', 'Crown Castle announced a potential purchase of FPL FiberNet, and Verizon is in the process of acquiring XO Communications. How to Help 5G — and Fiber? Unlike the current 4G technology, 5G requires a denser network of towers and radios to handle the traffic. Which in turn means: more fiber, to more places, faster. This makes the economics of deployment — and the wait for consumers — daunting. There are, however, things all levels of government can do right now to make deploying fiber easier and faster. Time, as they say, is money. Efficient access to poles, ducts, and conduit,', 'however, things all levels of government can do right now to make deploying fiber easier and faster. Time, as they say, is money. Efficient access to poles, ducts, and conduit, at fair prices has a direct impact on how quickly and cost effectively providers can deploy fiber.

As a grocer, this means being even more diligent about center store inventory, as it may not move as fast as you’re accustomed to, and may contribute to increased expired shrink. A few items in this area of the store (mainly sauces, dressings, and nuts) may sell out quicker than you’d expect, resulting in more out-of-stock situations that could affect your bottom line. Traditional rotating', 'this area of the store (mainly sauces, dressings, and nuts) may sell out quicker than you’d expect, resulting in more out-of-stock situations that could affect your bottom line.

Williamson With our focus on being metacognitive, I have been reflecting a great deal in the past week on the last twelve months. I wrote my first HEADlines since I retired at exactly this time last year, in part introducing our new ALiCE training. Our faculty had just practiced for that first drill at our in-service last February, and we have now conducted several faculty practices and a few student drills. Metacognition: Teaching Students to “Drive Their Brains” Even more noteworthy, we began our professional development work with Mike Anderson on metacognition at that in-service. A', 'and a few student drills. Metacognition: Teaching Students to “Drive Their Brains” Even more noteworthy, we began our professional development work with Mike Anderson on metacognition at that in-service. A year later, every faculty member and our staff have shifted to a more metacognitive practice, every faculty member has added at least one collaborative project with one or more colleagues, and every faculty member (unless on leave) has engaged with colleagues in collegial coaching to reinforce and develop skills that Mike has introduced to us. The Task Force’s call to action, in other words, has been embraced by the faculty', 'colleagues in collegial coaching to reinforce and develop skills that Mike has introduced to us. The Task Force’s call to action, in other words, has been embraced by the faculty in a way that Mike says is the envy of most schools, for whom resistance to change seems embedded in the system. There are certainly bedrock beliefs that we hold dear at Applewild: Core Values, Core Competencies, our commitment to knowing and valuing each student, broad and deep experiences across a rich curriculum, and our conviction that accelerated work can be achieved when children “have fun working hard.” At the', 'knowing and valuing each student, broad and deep experiences across a rich curriculum, and our conviction that accelerated work can be achieved when children “have fun working hard.” At the same time, Applewild’s faculty has demonstrated an important flexibility and nimbleness that is vital in order to address the fast pace of change in our world. As with any skill, this one is important to practice and keep elastic, just as it is to provide our students with the confidence to take the risk of being wrong, reflect, and adapt so learning can accelerate. That is one of the values', 'as it is to provide our students with the confidence to take the risk of being wrong, reflect, and adapt so learning can accelerate. That is one of the values of metacognition. The Task Force had researched what strategies have the most profound impacts on student learning, both immediately and over time. Metacognition and its related components (micro-teaching, reciprocal teaching, self-reported grades) and positive teacher – student relationships are in the top ten of 138 possible strategies. Already strong in relationships, we decided to enhance our program through metacognition. Mike confirmed this in a visual early on in his work', 'the top ten of 138 possible strategies. Already strong in relationships, we decided to enhance our program through metacognition. Mike confirmed this in a visual early on in his work with us (see diagram). In other words, over time, metacognitive practices accelerate learning by over half a grade. Service Learning We have seen how metacognition adds value to the learning experience through another initiative that began germinating a year ago – Service Learning.

After working to narrow down options with three faculty facilitators, our seventh graders presented five projects to the school; and Animal Welfare was adopted as the K – 8 project. As eighth graders this year, they became the leaders for all our other grades as specific grade level projects were developed. The eighth graders have now themselves reflected on the project and have returned to their grades to lead a school wide opportunity for reflection: design – feedback – redesign in action. We are now preparing to have eighth graders share their experiences directly with seventh graders', 'to lead a school wide opportunity for reflection: design – feedback – redesign in action. We are now preparing to have eighth graders share their experiences directly with seventh graders as the seventh grade takes on year two of leadership of our Service Learning. What did the eighth graders learn? Below are some examples of the insights that they had.

As defined by the 2010 United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, geoengineering mechanisms include “any technologies that deliberately reduce solar insolation or increase carbon sequestration from the atmosphere on a large scale that may affect biodiversity” (2). Put simply, the general goal of geoengineering is to decrease the greenhouse effect.', 'insolation or increase carbon sequestration from the atmosphere on a large scale that may affect biodiversity” (2). Put simply, the general goal of geoengineering is to decrease the greenhouse effect. This same United Nations Convention published a moratorium that prohibits field testing of geoengineering techniques by any person; on the other hand, the moratorium allows for “small scale scientific research studies that would be conducted in a controlled setting” (2). The obvious ambiguities of the United Nations’ geoengineering moratorium have prevented any serious enforcement of its policies.

In 2012, American entrepreneur Russ George conducted a unilateral iron fertilization experiment off the coast of western Canada (3). One of the main purposes of this experiment was to determine if the influx of iron would help boost the phytoplankton population in the area, since iron is a vital nutrient for phytoplankton and other marine primary producers (3). Higher phytoplankton population is correlated with more photosynthesis, which translates to a greater intake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. So, the hypothesis in this', 'other marine primary producers (3). Higher phytoplankton population is correlated with more photosynthesis, which translates to a greater intake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. So, the hypothesis in this case is that seeding the ocean with iron leads to greater sequestration and export of atmospheric carbon dioxide; this process should theoretically help reduce global temperatures over the long run by decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (3). George faced a considerable public outcry since he effectively violated the United Nations moratorium on geoengineering (3).

George faced a considerable public outcry since he effectively violated the United Nations moratorium on geoengineering (3). At this point in time, rather than concerning ourselves with the minutiae of international policy, it is much more meaningful for us to debate a more philosophical question: Is geoengineering the future of climate remediation? Geoengineering has only recently burst onto the scientific scene, and it presents a novel approach towards the long-standing issues of global warming and climate change. Below, we shall explore both sides of the debate and see how geoengineering fits into the evolution of science. Advocates of geoengineering', 'long-standing issues of global warming and climate change. Below, we shall explore both sides of the debate and see how geoengineering fits into the evolution of science. Advocates of geoengineering generally argue that efforts to simply slow down global warming have been fairly unsuccessful, thus necessitating proactive corrective action in the form of geoengineering. In a seminal paper, Dutch atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen points out that global carbon dioxide emissions would need to be reduced by 60- 80% to achieve zero net emissions, which is largely unfeasible (4). Crutzen then discusses the merits of spraying sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) into', 'would need to be reduced by 60- 80% to achieve zero net emissions, which is largely unfeasible (4). Crutzen then discusses the merits of spraying sulfur dioxide (SO2 ) into the atmosphere, since SO2 is known to reflect solar radiation back out into space, thus counteracting the greenhouse effect brought about by CO2 (4). There is fairly convincing empirical evidence that corroborates Crutzen’s case: following the 1991 Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption, which released 17 million tons (15.4 million metric tons) of SO2 , global temperatures dropped by about 0.6 ° C the next year.5 Although SO2 clearly can have a', 'eruption, which released 17 million tons (15.4 million metric tons) of SO2 , global temperatures dropped by about 0.6 ° C the next year.5 Although SO2 clearly can have a myriad of other side effects on the environment (e.g. acid rain), we see that it can potentially be a powerful tool for reversing the current trend of global warming, if we can find a way to harness it correctly. With temperatures increasing at their current rate, such techniques may very well become the only option to keep global temperatures at a sustainable level. Opponents of geoengineering present a fairly strong', 'temperatures increasing at their current rate, such techniques may very well become the only option to keep global temperatures at a sustainable level. Opponents of geoengineering present a fairly strong case as well. One common argument is that geoengineering involves excessive meddling with the environment, which more often than not results in environmental damage. As alluded to previously, SO2 injection often results in acid rain, which arguably has far more detrimental effects on the environment than potential benefits. With regard to iron fertilization in oceans, some geoengineering skeptics point out that massive phytoplankton blooms often form around seeded areas, disrupting', 'detrimental effects on the environment than potential benefits. With regard to iron fertilization in oceans, some geoengineering skeptics point out that massive phytoplankton blooms often form around seeded areas, disrupting the balance of the local food chain and sapping other vital nutrients from the waters (3). A second oppositional argument involves the notion of a moral hazard.6 Generally speaking, a moral hazard is where someone develops a solution to a problem, yet the presence of the solution makes people think that they no longer need to care about the problem and can behave as unscrupulously as they please.6 In the', 'problem, yet the presence of the solution makes people think that they no longer need to care about the problem and can behave as unscrupulously as they please.6 In the case of geoengineering, the moral hazard would be that if the general public becomes convinced that geoengineering can resolve all environmental issues, then the public will no longer care about using sustainable practices, since they will think that geoengineering can reverse all future damage that is done to the environment. This moral hazard argument generally would come into play at the policymaking stage, since lawmakers would now need to decide', 'reverse all future damage that is done to the environment. This moral hazard argument generally would come into play at the policymaking stage, since lawmakers would now need to decide how to regulate geoengineering practices. We thus continue to observe a spirited debate about the merits of geoengineering. This field holds immense promise and should be explored; however, the scientific community must take calculated steps to make sure that geoengineering’s power is harnessed in a manner that is beneficial on the whole to all stakeholders. Going forward, we can expect to see more discussion and exploration of geoengineering in the', 'power is harnessed in a manner that is beneficial on the whole to all stakeholders. Going forward, we can expect to see more discussion and exploration of geoengineering in the scientific community, as global warming continues to steadily progress.

Even inside East Jerusalem it was viewed as another local issue – just as the East Jerusalem village of Isawiyah was fighting police violence or Silwan was protesting archaeological excavations, Sheikh Jarrah was fighting against Jews’ efforts to evict them. Recently, however, it seems that Sheikh Jarrah has become a symbol. The young Palestinians who have been meeting at Jerusalem’s Damascus Gate since the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan have begun urging people to go to Sheikh Jarrah after mosque services. And they have been coming there every evening. Israeli police', 'beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan have begun urging people to go to Sheikh Jarrah after mosque services.

In addition, Hamas appears to have been looking for reasons to heighten tension with Israel over Jerusalem, after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas decided to postpone elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council. Hamas fired rockets from Gaza in identification with Palestinians in Jerusalem over the barriers at the Damascus Gate. But all of that follows the legal drama that is coming the fore again on Thursday. For roughly 30 years,', 'Palestinians in Jerusalem over the barriers at the Damascus Gate. But all of that follows the legal drama that is coming the fore again on Thursday. For roughly 30 years, Palestinian residents of Sheikh Jarrah have faced the risk of eviction because they live on land that was purchased by Jews at the end of the 19th century in the vicinity of the Tomb of Simeon the Just. The legal battle is being waged between the Palestinian residents and a company called Nachalat Shimon, which is controlled by right-wing activists seeking to bring Jews into the neighborhood. In recent months,', 'battle is being waged between the Palestinian residents and a company called Nachalat Shimon, which is controlled by right-wing activists seeking to bring Jews into the neighborhood. In recent months, the Palestinians have suffered a series of legal defeats that put about 300 neighborhood residents, including dozens of children, at risk of immediate eviction.

On Thursday, representatives of the Palestinians and the Jewish organizations are due to inform the Supreme Court over whether they have reached a settlement agreement.

Many people with an advanced level of intelligence oftentimes displayed peculiar habits, trends or rituals as children. Things like hypersensitivity, well-developed powers of abstraction, unusual or vivid imagination and a series of other quirks have been traditionally seen to color a genius’s childhood. This was not the case with Albert Einstein. The only peculiar trait Einstein displayed as a child was his aversion to talking. He spoke very little and was effectively mute until somewhere around age 7. In', 'Albert Einstein. The only peculiar trait Einstein displayed as a child was his aversion to talking. He spoke very little and was effectively mute until somewhere around age 7. In response to such preconceived notions, many popular myths have been attributed to him. For instance, it is popularly believed that Einstein was left-handed, had extreme difficulties in school, and possessed other strange quirks. Almost all of these oddities have been determined to be false. Ultimately, it should be noted that Albert Einstein had a normal childhood typical of his socio-economic class.

He played music, built models, built mechanical devices and once again, despite common misconceptions to the contrary, showed a strong aptitude for mathematics. From a very early age Einstein studied books on science, math and philosophical books including the Critique of Pure Reason and Euclid’s Elements.

Perhaps ‘smashing coach wheels’ would be a more accurate depiction? ) Einstein was more of a nerd-rebel; most of his acts of rebellion dealt with his aversion to the methods of academic institutions.

He strongly opposed the institutionalized way education was conducted. He frequently rebelled against authority figures in the school system and strongly rejected the teaching methods. In fact, he once wrote that the “true spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in strict role learning.” (The student in me has to add that this is a very brilliant sentiment.

In 1901, after living for an extended period of time in Aarau, Switzerland, Einstein acquired his diploma and official Swiss citizenship. Though he studied to be a teacher, he was unable to find a teaching position and instead took a position as a technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office.

In 1909 Einstein became Professor Extraordinary (quite a flashy title) at Zurich, and in 1911 he became a Professor of Theoretical Physics at Prague.

The fact of the matter is that most national pro-choice organizations have very little staff in most states. There are exceptions, but in many cases, there might be only a single executive director and perhaps one or two other staff and interns to protect reproductive rights within the entire state.

Now let’s look at the subject matter for this months Intelligence quiz. The CIPURSE™ Open Security Standard The CIPURSE™ open security standard promises to improve the performance and strengthen the security of public transit applications, as well as increase the availability of multiple sources for chip products. CIPURSE is designed to address the need of local and regional transit authorities for future-proof fare collection systems with better security than current systems. These systems will enable the public to use a single payment device–a simple, standalone ticket, multi-application card, microSD card, or NFC mobile phone–', 'systems with better security than current systems. These systems will enable the public to use a single payment device–a simple, standalone ticket, multi-application card, microSD card, or NFC mobile phone– seamlessly across several modes of transportation in different locations –even different regions and systems. Current transit fare collection systems often use proprietary Mifare Classic technology. However, the security of this technology has been compromised, creating demand by transit agencies for advanced security solutions based on open standards. CIPURSE uses AES128. The open AES encryption scheme has been thoroughly tested and is widely accepted. AES was selected by the German Federal', 'advanced security solutions based on open standards. CIPURSE uses AES128. The open AES encryption scheme has been thoroughly tested and is widely accepted. AES was selected by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI,) and is also used by the U.S. Government, including the National Security Agency (NSA). CIPURSE also employs an advanced authentication scheme designed to withstand electronic attacks without requiring dedicated hardware. A unique design allows all applications , from low-end limited-use tickets to high value cards such as multi-application cards or NFC devices that combine payment with transit fare applications, to benefit from the same security', 'applications , from low-end limited-use tickets to high value cards such as multi-application cards or NFC devices that combine payment with transit fare applications, to benefit from the same security concept and unique security advantages. In addition, product development can be cost optimized across the entire range. CIPURSE builds on current proven open standards–the ISO 7816 Smart Card Standard, AES128, and the ISO/IEC 14443-4 protocol layer. CIPURSE is available to all industry stakeholders under fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms. And finally, CIPURSE is governed by the OSPT Alliance, which is an open and not-for profit industry association.

Before climate science became the target of ideological idiocy, the American', 'impact is immediate. On the other hand, climate change is caused everywhere and its impact is in the future. Before climate science became the target of ideological idiocy, the American right developed market-based methods of moving away from fossil fuels. One of the most creative methods was something called cap and trade. The idea was to raise the price of fossil fuels in order to speed that day that renewable energy could compete with fossil fuels on price. Not a bad idea and we came pretty close to adopting that policy with the Waxman-Markey bill in the U.S. Congress. Unfortunately,', 'energy could compete with fossil fuels on price. Not a bad idea and we came pretty close to adopting that policy with the Waxman-Markey bill in the U.S. Congress.

They correctly see the danger of climate change, but do not see the political dangers that can be posed by sudden economic change. Some advocate policies that would imperil the world’s economy. There is no question that we need to transition to a fossil fuel free economy. The issue is how, and at what pace? An immediate reduction of fossil fuels to the levels suggested by some climate scientists (for example, 350 parts per million) would reduce economic consumption and production, set off a world-wide depression, and stimulate mass political instability.

Politicians concerned about retaining power would never allow the world’s economy to be slowed down to prevent climate change and so there is no chance that such a sudden and dramatic reduction in fossil fuel use would reach the political agenda.

Many local governments, such as the C40 cities led by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, have begun active efforts to reduce carbon generation. Corporations all over the world are becoming more energy-efficient and increasing their use of renewable energy. In our own country, during fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011, a total of over $100 billion of incremental government resources were allocated to renewable energy research and development.

While these resources were short-term, investment continues outside the U.S. and the price of solar power continues to come down while the price of most fossil fuels continuing to rise.

At least the following seven states have exemptions similar to the SEC’s new exemption: However, while this exemption is not terribly uncommon and is generally granted with a good intention, namely protecting the financial and proprietary information collected from private agencies during regulatory investigations, the current Federal exemption has a few problems.

Questions of interdisciplinarity within digital social research contexts have recently identified language as a key area through', 'tentatively outline in this blog, it is also has ontological features and consequences. Questions of interdisciplinarity within digital social research contexts have recently identified language as a key area through which collaboration can be hindered and the realization of interdisciplinary working between sociologists, say, and computer scientists impeded. Of course language, as a communicative practice, is key. As are the practical means through which theorization, methodological strategies and the collection and curation of data are accomplished; in ways that can answer jointly identified problems and questions e.g. whether social media data can be used to augment traditional social scientific methods', 'and curation of data are accomplished; in ways that can answer jointly identified problems and questions e.g. whether social media data can be used to augment traditional social scientific methods for understanding public reaction to signal events? However, the tools and framework for interdisciplinary working require reflection and work by those who wish to participate. The problems and challenges associated with interdisciplinary collaboration are not merely those associated with translation and are therefore not reducible to a single fix. There is no interdisciplinary Babel Fish; and no single solution that stands outside a range of practices that are built through', 'and are therefore not reducible to a single fix. There is no interdisciplinary Babel Fish; and no single solution that stands outside a range of practices that are built through interaction in interdisciplinary settings and contexts. For example, we might wish to consider the ways in which teams are organized, how the choice architecture of collaborative tools that we develop or use are shaped, how we foster the ability to take another disciplines ‘point of view’ and how we participate in and attend to the negotiation and accomplishment of both a shared perspective and our own disciplinary awareness at one', 'take another disciplines ‘point of view’ and how we participate in and attend to the negotiation and accomplishment of both a shared perspective and our own disciplinary awareness at one and the same time. A key issue here is the ways in which core disciplinary concerns and questions coalesce and shape how, for example, an interdisciplinary research group may approach a specific research problem. This is more than language and more akin to a requirement to spend some time immersing oneself or at least systematically reflecting on different disciplinary forms of life and the social life of paradigms. Whilst I', 'more akin to a requirement to spend some time immersing oneself or at least systematically reflecting on different disciplinary forms of life and the social life of paradigms. Whilst I am looking at a problem or phenomenon in terms of prosaic questions such as social organization my computer scientist friend maybe viewing these through the lens of information and dreams of automation. A useful resource here can be found in Schön’s ideas surrounding ‘the reflective practitioner’ (1983). This was a popular trope in the late 1980’s and 1990’s for developing the knowledge capacity of key professional groups such as nurses,', 'Schön’s ideas surrounding ‘the reflective practitioner’ (1983). This was a popular trope in the late 1980’s and 1990’s for developing the knowledge capacity of key professional groups such as nurses, social workers, engineers, architects and teachers as they confronted new problems, institutional structures and the reorganization of working life around teams and inter-professional working and delivery. I re-introduce it now as it might be an effective starting point for thinking about how we might promote reflective engagement by participants within interdisciplinary contexts such as ‘digital social research’, ‘computational social science’ and related fields such as ‘social media analytics’; betwixt and', 'about how we might promote reflective engagement by participants within interdisciplinary contexts such as ‘digital social research’, ‘computational social science’ and related fields such as ‘social media analytics’; betwixt and between different academic groups and aligned ‘knowledge agents’ often collaborating and competing, working and fighting, in liminal, status poor spaces. Schön (1991:269) in his discussion of reflective practice argues that variations between professions (as the modern ‘knowledge agent’ ideal type) can be contrasted with specific constants. He argues that these constants provide for a means of considering the variation of practice between different professions. Members of disciplinary cultures are readily', 'can be contrasted with specific constants. He argues that these constants provide for a means of considering the variation of practice between different professions. Members of disciplinary cultures are readily socialised into patterned forms of knowledge, interpretation and practice. The academic tribes of ‘sociologists’, ‘computer scientists’ or ‘discourse analysts’ and ‘social statisticians’ are anthropologically consistent in this regard. Whilst wider institutional and socio-technical forces are revolutionising knowledge work in ways not anticipated twenty to thirty years ago, distinct ‘professional groups’ remain with new ones emerging on the horizon e.g. the data scientist. According to Schön (1983:270) these constants or ‘patterns’', 'not anticipated twenty to thirty years ago, distinct ‘professional groups’ remain with new ones emerging on the horizon e.g. the data scientist. According to Schön (1983:270) these constants or ‘patterns’ associated with knowledge groups and agents can be described in terms of the following: - The media, languages, and repertoires that practitioners use to describe reality and conduct experiments - The appreciative systems they bring to problem setting, to the evaluation of inquiry, and to reflective conversation - The overarching theories by which they make sense of phenomena - The role frames within which they set their tasks and through', 'evaluation of inquiry, and to reflective conversation - The overarching theories by which they make sense of phenomena - The role frames within which they set their tasks and through which they bound their institutional settings Perhaps these four phenomenological constants could form a matrix through which we can begin to link reflection with a more mindful form of reflective practice within interdisciplinary research contexts. In terms of the case being considered, perhaps collaboration between computer scientists and sociologists (and other social scientists) might benefit from some form of systematic training for those embarking on cross-disciplinary engagement in the hope', 'being considered, perhaps collaboration between computer scientists and sociologists (and other social scientists) might benefit from some form of systematic training for those embarking on cross-disciplinary engagement in the hope of charting new territory and understanding new things through innovative theoretical, methodological and data driven interdisciplinary strategies. At the very least it is worth thinking about as a means of informing the process through which we become practical interdisciplinarians.

A job description is a written statement that describes the main objective of a job, its essential and nonessential functions, the qualifications, and other information. A job description may describe duties, skills, effort, and responsibilities, environmental and working conditions, and the education and experience required. It also may include information on tools and equipment used and relationships with other jobs. Thirty people may hold the same job and, therefore, use the same job description. It is important to remember that a job description describes the job, not the person or persons who', 'may hold the same job and, therefore, use the same job description. It is important to remember that a job description describes the job, not the person or persons who hold that job. There are two basic types of job descriptions: “generic” or general and “specific” or individual. In addition, position descriptions often are written for individual, high-level managerial employees. Specific Or Generic? The specific job description provides information on all the essential duties and responsibilities assigned to one or more individuals performing the job. It is usually quite detailed and comprehensive and provides a sound basis for job evaluation,', 'all the essential duties and responsibilities assigned to one or more individuals performing the job. It is usually quite detailed and comprehensive and provides a sound basis for job evaluation, training, orientation, and human resources/personnel organizational planning. This type of description demands a thorough job analysis, considerable care and expertise in preparation, and an effort to keep it useful and up to date.

There is also a tendency to exclude incidental responsibilities and duties, and disagreements can arise between supervisors and employees when relatively minor job duties change. Generic job descriptions, on the other hand, are written in broadly stated, general terms without identifying specific functions, tasks, and responsibilities. A generic description is applicable to a group of similar or near-similar jobs, and therefore the per-job cost of preparation is lower. However, since the description must be written broadly enough to allow for some variations in product, equipment and materials used, or procedures,', 'therefore the per-job cost of preparation is lower. However, since the description must be written broadly enough to allow for some variations in product, equipment and materials used, or procedures, it may include some functions performed in one or more of the jobs but not all of them. Today, because of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), use of the generic job description is not recommended. While the ADA doesn’t require job descriptions, it does require that applicants and employees be able to perform the “essential functions” of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation. However, the EEOC has said', 'require job descriptions, it does require that applicants and employees be able to perform the “essential functions” of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation.

Here Robert Oscar, registered pharmacist and CEO of RxEOB, a healthcare company that offers web technology, analytics and automated services, discusses four ways the growing mobile health market may benefit patients and providers. 1. Increase medication compliance. Mobile technology can help patients adhere to medication orders. It can tell patients why medical adherence, especially prescription adherence, is important by sending them messages and information. “While no one can guarantee patients will actually read or even absorb the information, allowing them access in an easy, convenient method is a start,” says', 'them messages and information. “While no one can guarantee patients will actually read or even absorb the information, allowing them access in an easy, convenient method is a start,” says Mr. Oscar. Mobile technology can also calculate when a prescription should run out and then send the patient a reminder to get a refill. When the patient refills their medication, mobile technology can send dosage reminders such as “It is 7 a.m. Time to take your blood pressure medication.” Finally, mobile technology can ask the patient if they took their medication or not. “It works as a delayed reminder but', '7 a.m. Time to take your blood pressure medication.” Finally, mobile technology can ask the patient if they took their medication or not. “It works as a delayed reminder but it also provides a way to document whether the patient took their medication,” says Mr. Oscar. These capabilities offer hospitals a method to lower medication noncompliance, one of the biggest factors in high hospital readmissions. A 2009 article published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 17.6 percent of hospital admissions resulted in readmissions within 30 days of discharge, 11.5 percent within 15 days and 6.2 percent within', 'the New England Journal of Medicine found that 17.6 percent of hospital admissions resulted in readmissions within 30 days of discharge, 11.5 percent within 15 days and 6.2 percent within 7 days.

Patients receive a lot of paperwork and instructions when they are discharged from the hospital. The scenario is not conducive to patients remembering detailed treatment and prescription requirements. Mobile technology might help patients recall the information onslaught they receive at hospital discharge by sending post-treatment instruction reminders.

Key takeaways The concept of ESG analysis has evolved over the years and is becoming integral to fundamental credit research. The Corporate Credit Team believes that rigorous application of ESG analysis can improve risk-adjusted returns. Sound investment sense, growing client demand and efficient capital allocation underscore the importance and relevance of ESG analysis. ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance, and refers to three central factors in measuring the sustainability of an investment. It was derived from the', 'and relevance of ESG analysis. ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance, and refers to three central factors in measuring the sustainability of an investment. It was derived from the ‘Triple Bottom Line’, also known as the ‘People, Planet and Profits’ (PPP), a concept introduced in the 1990s. It argued that businesses should focus on each of the three ‘P’s and not just on ‘Profits’, since they were equally important for any commercial enterprise to be sustainable.

This concept evolved into the focus of ESG, which today is the bedrock of Sustainable and Responsible Investing (SRI). /> Environmental criteria examine how a business contributes to and performs on environmental challenges (e.g. waste, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and climate change). Social criteria look at how the company treats people (e.g. human capital management, diversity and equal opportunities, work conditions, health & safety, and product misselling), while Governance criteria examine how a company is governed (e.g. executive remuneration, tax practices and strategy, corruption and bribery, and board diversity and structure). At', '& safety, and product misselling), while Governance criteria examine how a company is governed (e.g. executive remuneration, tax practices and strategy, corruption and bribery, and board diversity and structure). At the heart of ESG investing is the simple idea that companies are more likely to succeed and deliver strong returns1 if they create value for all their stakeholders – employees, customers, suppliers and wider society including the environment – and not just the company owners.

Just as with other credit metrics, we would expect improving ESG profiles to lead to a lower cost of capital.

Conversely, if a company has material ESG risks and is not actively mitigating these risks and improving their ESG profile, it is very likely that its bond prices will suffer.

In ethical investing managers employ a negative screen approach to generate ‘ethical or moral returns’ and screen out controversial ‘sin’ sectors. While negative screening is very straightforward to implement and has historically been used by early adopters of sustainability principles, a growing number of firms are now also aiming to apply ESG in order to take advantage of opportunities and select sectors and companies based on their positive ESG performance.

ESG analysis can provide valuable insights about factors that can have a significant impact on the financial metrics of a company and therefore better inform our investment decisions.
